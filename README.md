TODOS

 - [X] Display all Pokemon on one page
 - [X] Integrate ~~hilt~~ Koin + Compose (+ ViewModel)
    - Using Koin rn as this is what we'll be using on T-Mobile, but can do Hilt eventually
 - [ ] Pagination?
   - Custom impl vs. paging3
 
Stretch Goals
 - [ ] Details screen
    - What to use for navigation??? `compose-navigation`? going to go to TMO
      Android sync and see what people think
 - [ ] CoordinatorLayout/Toolbar + NestedScrollView if possible

Eventually:
 - [ ] Testing / FragmentScenarios
    - How necessary are these with Compose? 
 - [ ] GraphQL
 - [ ] Add some juice
